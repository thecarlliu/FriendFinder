# Snelling Scots
###Created by Carl Liu
####Snelling Scots is a simple Express web app that allows the user to answer a questionnaire, and with those results, compare the user to a list of other people in order to determine which of them the user is most compatible with.

####TODOs:

- add submit button and hiddenmodal to survey page, adjust css
- create about page layout (logo+intro+galleryspace+hiddenmodal)
- add scots info samples (waiting on survey responses)
- convert list[i].responses to arrays of integers once enough samples are received
