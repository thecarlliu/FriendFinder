# Snelling Scots
###Created by Carl Liu
####Snelling Scots is a simple Express web app that allows the user to answer a questionnaire, and with those results, compare the user to a list of other people in order to determine which of them the user is most compatible with.

####TODOs:

- add more scots as samples come in
- finish questions and matching algorithm: convert list[i].responses to arrays of integers once enough samples are received
