# Snelling Scots
###Created by Carl Liu
####Snelling Scots is a simple Express web app that allows the user to answer a questionnaire, and with those results, compare the user to a list of other people in order to determine which of them the user is most compatible with.

####TODOs:

- reorder answer choices on a scale
- add images to answer choices (after placing avatar images into a folder called avatars, choice images go into folder called choices)

- add more scots as samples come in
- convert responses in scots.js to integers on scale based on choices of answers.
- create a samples.txt to store raw sample responses
