# Snelling Scots
###Created by Carl Liu
####Snelling Scots is a simple Express web app that allows the user to answer a questionnaire, and with those results, compare the user to a list of other people in order to determine which of them the user is most compatible with.

####TODOs:
- for now, saving sample responses as text directly into list. later, create a scale and weigh each response (give them each a value for comparison).
- add scots info samples (waiting on survey responses)
- create survey page layout (logo+surveyspace+hiddenmodal)
- create about page layout (logo+intro+galleryspace+hiddenmodal)
