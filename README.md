# Snelling Scots
###Created by Carl Liu
####Snelling Scots is a simple Express web app that allows the user to answer a questionnaire, and with those results, compare the user to a list of other people in order to determine which of them the user is most compatible with.

####TODOs:

- Carousel items displaying, but not occupying enough space (carousel too small need to change height)
- add more scots as samples come in
- finish questions and matching convert responses in scots.js to integers on scale based on choices of answers.
