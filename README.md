###Created by Carl Liu
####Snelling Scots is a simple Express web app that allows the user to answer a questionnaire, and with those results, compare the user to a list of other people in order to determine which of them the user is most compatible with.

####TODOs:
- add scots info
- create survey page layout
- create about page layout
- about page should give brief intro for what the snelling scots are and should show a card for each scot
- if user clicks on card, display modal pop-up with pic of scot and random question + answer as a fun fact.
- adapt findMatch() function
