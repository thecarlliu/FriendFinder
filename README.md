# Snelling Scots
###Created by Carl Liu
####Snelling Scots is a simple Express web app that allows the user to answer a buzzfeed-type questionnaire, and with those results, compare the user to a list of other people in order to determine which of them the user is most compatible with.

####TODOs:

- reorder answer choices on a scale
- continue with q9
- add images to answer choices (images/choices)

- convert responses in scots.js to integers on scale based on choices of answers.

-almost done!
